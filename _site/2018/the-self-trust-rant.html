      <blockquote>
  <p>Trust yourself, you know more than you think you do. - Benjamin Spock</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the quoted/misquoted quotes, global personalities, superheroes and everyday lore you hear, guide all its energy to one thing; this estranged character on which our civilization thrives:  <em>making an attempt, give it a try</em>. Whether the certainty of the outcome is known, predictable or unknown, the effort of “trying” to do something is always compared to its direct outcome; necessarily a positive one.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQFaNJCUt_vzxA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1524330042897?e=1709164800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=u_2-tbmxDgPliP3Oq3adLn21KY3vffoLNX8mi4522jg" alt=""></p>

<p>Due to the much #HUSTLE hype, everyone is trying to do a lot of things and many of them are doing his or her thing really well. Now, let’s not only stick to an entrepreneur as the doers here. There is a huge, huge population which makes it to their work every day (be it an advertising executive or a plumber) and they “try” their day’s best to do things they are supposed to do. As part of the popular culture, they are expected, each one of them; to set &amp; break benchmarks, become stars of their function, use time as vitamins, do their work with an unmatched zeal and be indispensable. But we all aren’t the most productive and ROI optimized in our actions. Therefore, a huge part of this huge, huge population ends up under-delivering the expected while overloading on the byproducts: disinterest, boredom and, lack of conscious respect for one’s own work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what is going wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many things. But I’d like to mention one, a special low hanging fruit called Self-Trust and its retrospective in what we do. Often used as words like Belief, Hope and Confidence, in all its etymology the best &amp; perhaps most important aspect of them come up when a prefix “Self-” is added in front of them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Self Trust is a major miss today and hence, an alarmingly important ingredient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These misses are there because of the competitive nature of our environment and, the lack of a conscious pass-over at work or home. Also, Hollywood (no movie rants ahead). If asked about one’s confidence in everything they do in their 9-to-5 (or, 11-to-8), the common answers that pop up are,</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is there, somewhere.</li>
  <li>None whatsoever. What I do is meaningless to me.</li>
  <li>It is there, lots of it; jacking up for the “special work” from the future.</li>
  <li>My manager takes decision for me.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The underlying purpose of one’s work becomes so subliminal to their own eyes, that they don’t see their own effort’s value, trusted actions and, consider placing their belief in the smaller things too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even in recent times, people have moved mountains with Self Trust in our Work. A great example of it is Elon Musk. The technology maverick has not always been the favourite poster child for the “entrepreneurial spirit”. In fact, both of his flagship companies Tesla Motors and SpaceX have seen miserable times. There was a certain time when all of Elon’s fortune was invested deep into his two companies. However, despite all that came, Elon had a strong trust in himself, why he wanted to do what he’s doing (to eradicate the use of fossil fuels from Earth) and an unshaken trust in what he was doing (building cars and spaceships). The energy this self-trust induced had a team-level impact on Tesla and SpaceX. Not only all of his teams believed in what they were doing and trusted the methods they were trying. It gave Elon a leadership splurge like no other. This was, of course, followed by the public’s trust in Elon and his companies. Don’t you love what he’s doing with Tesla or SpaceX?</p>

<p><em>I’d also want to quote Steve Jobs on this, but that’ll be too much of a cliche to handle.</em></p>

<p>Now, what needs to be done? If there is no visible trust in oneself &amp; one’s work, it has been brought around by people surrounding this person — friends, family, coworkers. Showing gratitude and letting people know that you trust them with their work, process and method is the biggest cultural gateway a company can move towards. While it may look difficult for a larger organization, smaller ones can start nurturing this exercise, in their contained environment on conversations. Moreover, as individuals, we should be consciously aware of what we are doing and why we are doing it to sustain, well, trust in ourselves. :)</p>
