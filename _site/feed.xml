It’s that other 10% that makes for the best stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TP-Link plug controlling the geyser? Mostly reliable, but has inexplicably decided that 4:47am is the optimal pre-heating time. Not 4:45. Not 5:00. Specifically 4:47am, every single day. I’ve stopped questioning the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Wipro bulbs usually respond instantly, but occasionally take a coffee break. “Turn off bedroom light” works fine until that one Tuesday when it decides to happen sometime around next Diwali. The Syska bathroom bulb is normally perfect, but once in a while has Vietnam flashbacks and strobes like there’s a raid happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phillips Wiz bulb connects flawlessly… mostly. Except it seems to have developed a Tuesday-only work schedule. I’ve actually tested this. Monday? “Device unreachable.” Wednesday? “Cannot find device.” Tuesday at 3pm? Works like absolute magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing though - Google Home manages all these devices better than their own apps ever could. The TP-Link Kasa app crashes, the Wipro app forgets my login, but Google Home? It just works. It’s the universal translator of smart home chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-occasional-guest-demo&quot;&gt;The Occasional Guest Demo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend visits: “Wow, smart home! Show me how it works!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything working perfectly for 3 months straight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Friend arrives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Demonstration mode activates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “Hey Google, turn on living room lights.”&lt;br /&gt;
Google: “Playing ‘Living on a Prayer’ by Bon Jovi on YouTube Music.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bathroom randomly starts strobing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Geyser decides it’s 4:47am somewhere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend: “That’s… interesting.”&lt;br /&gt;
Me: “I swear this literally never happens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It literally never happens. Except during demos. Always during demos.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-truth-about-smart-home-management&quot;&gt;The Truth About Smart Home Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Home&lt;/strong&gt;: The universal remote that actually works. Manages everything seamlessly, rarely crashes, understands context. It’s basically the diplomatic translator between me and my devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Apps&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TP-Link Kasa: Works fine, but why open an app when Google Home exists?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wipro Next: Forgets my login every update&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phillips Wiz: Beautiful interface, but Google Home just does it faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality&lt;/strong&gt;: Smart homes are actually pretty great. The devices work reliably, Google Home makes everything simple, and when things go weird, it’s more funny than frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone storage used by smart home apps: 2.3GB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Actual time spent using those apps: 5 minutes per month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Time saved by Google Home: Probably my sanity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? When everything works (which is most of the time), you forget how convenient it all is. Until you visit someone else’s house and find yourself saying “Hey Google, turn off the lights” to their very analog wall switch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="smart-home" /><category term="iot" /><summary type="html">My smart home works great 90% of the time.

Despite all our design system advances and component libraries, we’re still fighting the same battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t just aesthetic—though yes, most forms are painfully ugly. The real issue is that forms exist at the intersection of user psychology, technical constraints, and business requirements. And that intersection is messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ux-minefield&quot;&gt;The UX minefield&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every form decision feels like walking through a minefield. Should the submit button be blue or green? Does it matter? (Spoiler: it does, but not for the reasons you think.) Where do you place the required field indicators? What about error states? Do you validate on blur, on submit, or in real-time? Each choice cascades into a dozen other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent countless hours A/B testing form layouts only to discover that the “winning” variation performs worse when the weather changes. Okay, not literally the weather, but external factors you never considered: the traffic source, the device orientation, the time of day, whether users came from a social media ad or organic search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-technical-rabbit-hole&quot;&gt;The technical rabbit hole&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the technical side. Cross-browser compatibility for form styling is still a nightmare in 2025. Want to style a select dropdown consistently? Good luck. Need file uploads that don’t look like they’re from 2005? Prepare to build everything from scratch or depend on a library that weighs more than your entire CSS framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto-complete attributes seemed promising until you realize half the implementations are broken. Password managers work great until they don’t. Mobile keyboards switch context unpredictably. And don’t get me started on the iOS Safari zoom-on-focus behavior that Apple refuses to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-business-pressure-cooker&quot;&gt;The business pressure cooker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business stakeholders want “just one more field” for better lead qualification. Marketing needs UTM parameters captured. Legal requires explicit consent checkboxes. Sales wants phone number validation. Each addition increases abandonment rates, but try explaining that correlation to someone whose quarterly targets depend on lead volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part? Forms that convert well often look terrible, and beautiful forms often convert poorly. There’s no reliable correlation between aesthetic appeal and functional success. I’ve seen gorgeously designed forms with sub-2% conversion rates, and ugly-but-functional forms pulling 15%+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-actually-works&quot;&gt;What actually works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hundreds of form implementations, here’s what I’ve learned works—not always, but often enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it stupid simple.&lt;/strong&gt; Every field you remove improves conversion more than any design tweak ever will. That “company size” dropdown can wait until after they’ve signed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive disclosure.&lt;/strong&gt; Show fields as they become relevant. Multi-step forms often outperform single-page ones, despite conventional wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time validation that doesn’t annoy.&lt;/strong&gt; Validate format (email structure, phone format) immediately, but wait for business rules (duplicate email, invalid coupon) until submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile-first everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Your beautiful desktop form is meaningless if 70% of your traffic can’t fill it out on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-unfortunate-truth&quot;&gt;The unfortunate truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real issue with forms isn’t technical—it’s that they represent the exact moment when user and business interests diverge. Users want to give you as little information as possible; businesses want to collect everything they can. Users want speed; businesses want accuracy. Users want privacy; businesses want tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms are the compromise nobody asked for, implemented by developers who know the technical constraints, designed by designers who understand visual hierarchy, and optimized by marketers who care about conversion rates. But rarely do all three perspectives align in a single implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve gotten better at building forms, but we haven’t solved the fundamental problem: they’re still an interruption in the user’s journey, a necessary evil that stands between want and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why, despite all our advances in web technology, forms remain stubbornly mediocre. They’re not a technical problem to be solved, but a human one to be managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And until we figure out how to read minds, we’re stuck with them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="webdev" /><category term="ux" /><category term="design" /><summary type="html">After years of building landing pages and lead gen campaigns, I’ve come to a sobering realization: forms remain the most frustrating part of web UX.

I wanted to continue using my iPhone for my personal number and decided to shift the demanding workload to a separate, new phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a month of consideration, I bought a Nothing Phone 2A—probably the most well-designed device in its range. It has been over three months since I started using it as my everyday, constantly buzzing companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a review. Instead, it’s an appreciation for budget phones in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing dramatically new happening in the flagship space. They all look the same generation by generation, having peaked at the “glass and metal” industrial design they established a few years ago. The only exceptions are a handful of folding phone models (the screen folds, and that’s where the innovation ends). The budget section, however, will spoil you. Especially the ₹20-30K category—it has absolutely blown up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category, once fronted by champions like the OnePlus One, became mostly a parade of mediocrely named models over the last 3-4 years. Every brand would dump multiple models into this segment with barely discernible differences. Samsung’s Galaxy M series, in my opinion, takes the crown for this approach: M01, M20, M21, M30, M31, M32…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While naming conventions remain questionable, what you can now get in this price range was mind-blowing for me. Features you’d expect from a flagship—solid IP ratings, thoughtful design, functional software with reliable support, and impressive camera arrays—are all available in the budget segment. More importantly, the overall quality has shot up dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The democratization of premium features isn’t just a marketing strategy—it’s a fundamental shift in how smartphone technology matures and proliferates. The Nothing Phone 2A embodies this transformation perfectly. Its transparent design language and distinctive LED interface aren’t merely aesthetic choices; they represent how budget phones have become platforms for meaningful innovation rather than just cost-cutting exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly intriguing is how this evolution challenges our traditional understanding of smartphone market segmentation. The lines between “flagship” and “budget” are blurring in ways that weren’t conceivable even two years ago. Consider the fundamentals: display technology has reached a point where high refresh rates and OLED panels, once exclusive to flagships, are now standard in this segment. The Nothing Phone 2A’s 120Hz OLED display isn’t just a specification—it’s a testament to how manufacturing scale and technological maturity have transformed the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software landscape tells an equally compelling story. In a move that outpaced many premium devices, Nothing OS received its Android 15 upgrade in December. This swift software adoption isn’t just about bragging rights—it’s a clear signal that budget devices are no longer afterthoughts in the Android ecosystem. While several flagship devices from established manufacturers are still waiting for their Android 15 updates, this rapid deployment demonstrates how the traditional hierarchy of software support is being disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most significant shift is in the overall user experience. The budget segment isn’t just about specifications anymore; it’s about delivering a cohesive experience. Nothing OS 2.5, now based on Android 15, demonstrates how software optimization can rival flagship smoothness without requiring cutting-edge hardware. This raises an interesting question: are we approaching a point of diminishing returns in smartphone innovation where the premium segment must justify its existence beyond mere specification superiority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera systems in this price range deserve special attention. While they may not match flagship computational photography capabilities, they’ve reached a level of competence that satisfies most users’ needs. The focus has shifted from raw megapixel counts to actually useful features like reliable night mode photography and stable video recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, this democratization of features poses both opportunities and challenges for the industry. Premium manufacturers must now innovate beyond incremental improvements to justify their price points. Meanwhile, budget phone makers are under pressure to maintain this delicate balance between feature inclusion and cost management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real winner in this evolution is the consumer.&lt;/strong&gt; When a sub-₹30K phone can deliver an IP54 rating, decent build quality, and a thoughtful user experience, it fundamentally changes the value proposition of smartphones across all segments. It’s not just about getting more for less—it’s about redefining what we consider essential in a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation of the budget segment isn’t just following trends—it’s actively shaping them. The Nothing Phone 2A and its contemporaries aren’t just alternatives to flagships; they’re harbingers of a more accessible and innovative smartphone future. As we witness this evolution, one thing becomes clear: the future of smartphone innovation might not be coming from where we traditionally expected it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether budget phones can compete with flagships anymore—it’s about how flagships will maintain their relevance in an increasingly competitive landscape where “budget” no longer means compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="smartphones" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html">The weight of two SIMs on my iPhone 13 Mini was beyond what the tiny battery could handle for a full work day.

While Apple Notes has long served as the default cognitive extension for millions of iOS users, the evolving complexity of our digital lives demands a more sophisticated approach to personal knowledge management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack why Apple Notes, despite its seamless integration and reliable sync, falls short of contemporary needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cognitive-stack-problem&quot;&gt;The Cognitive Stack Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern knowledge workers don’t just take notes – they build digital gardens, connect ideas across domains, and require their note-taking system to serve as an external brain. Apple Notes’ linear organization model, while clean, fails to capture the natural neural networks of human thought. We’re no longer simply jotting down shopping lists or meeting minutes; we’re architecting personal knowledge bases that demand robust linking, tagging, and emergent organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our digital lives span multiple platforms and contexts, the walled garden of Apple’s ecosystem becomes less tenable. Cross-platform knowledge workers require their notes to flow seamlessly between devices, operating systems, and workflows. Apple Notes’ platform-centric approach, while polished within its ecosystem, creates friction in an increasingly heterogeneous computing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-media-richness-deficit&quot;&gt;The Media Richness Deficit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary note-taking transcends text. We think in images, diagrams, code snippets, and dynamic embeds. While Apple Notes supports basic rich media, it lacks the sophisticated handling of modern knowledge types – from mathematical notation to interactive diagrams. The future of note-taking isn’t just about storing information; it’s about making it dynamic and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-collaboration-conundrum&quot;&gt;The Collaboration Conundrum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge creation in 2024 is inherently collaborative. Teams need to co-create, share contexts, and build collective intelligence. Apple Notes’ sharing features, while functional, don’t support the kind of rich, real-time collaboration that modern knowledge work demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-intelligence&quot;&gt;Apple Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AI will become like a personal assistant, a part of our cognitive processes, note-taking applications need to become AI-ready platforms. The ability to analyze, synthesize, and augment our notes with AI capabilities will be crucial. Apple Notes’ closed architecture makes it challenging to integrate with emerging AI tools and workflows. All that said, Apple Intelligence doesn’t cut it. There are superior note apps like Amie, where AI is an organisation/maanagement app than a writing app. Apple Notes is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next generation of note-taking tools needs to address these fundamental limitations. We’re seeing promising developments in tools that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support non-linear thought organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable seamless cross-platform synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handle rich media and interactive content natively&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facilitate real-time collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate with AI for enhanced knowledge processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether Apple Notes is sufficient – it’s about understanding how our relationship with digital knowledge is evolving. As we move towards more sophisticated forms of personal knowledge management, the tools we use must evolve to support not just note-taking, but thought-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, Notes will remain a convenient default. However, the future of personal knowledge management demands tools that can grow with our increasingly complex cognitive needs. The next frontier isn’t about better note-taking – it’s about better thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This shift raises critical questions for the industry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will AI integration transform personal knowledge management?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we create truly platform-agnostic knowledge systems?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What role will interoperability standards play in the future of note-taking?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we balance sophisticated features with intuitive user experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations of Apple Notes aren’t just about feature gaps – they’re about the evolving nature of how we capture, process, and utilize information  and how it’s features are probably made for a mid-power, household user (who doesn’t exist!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="apple" /><category term="notes," /><category term="note" /><category term="taking" /><summary type="html">The digital note-taking landscape sits at a fascinating inflection point in 2024.

However, the setup process wasn’t as smooth as I anticipated, especially when it came to connecting the speaker to my Wi-Fi network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting to 5GHz Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit a snag. When I tried to set up the speaker using the Sonos app, I noticed that my 5GHz network wasn’t listed among the available Wi-Fi networks. Oddly enough, the 2.4GHz network appeared just fine. This was puzzling because media devices generally perform better on 5GHz networks due to their higher bandwidth capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Wi-Fi Channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to resolve this issue, I dived into some research. I learned that Wi-Fi networks operate on various channels, and these channels can affect the connectivity of devices. Specifically, the 5GHz band has a range of channels, and not all devices are compatible with every channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the Sonos works best on certain channels within the 5GHz band, particularly Channel 44. This was a revelation because my router was set to ‘Auto’ for channel selection, meaning it could have been using a channel incompatible with my Sonos speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: Manual Channel Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution was clear: I needed to manually set my router to use Channel 44 on the 5GHz band. After accessing my router’s settings and making this adjustment, I attempted to connect my Sonos speaker again. This time, it worked flawlessly! The speaker connected to the 5GHz network without any further issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my Sonos Era 100 is up and running on the 5GHz network, delivering the high-quality audio experience I was looking forward to. This experience taught me the importance of understanding the technical aspects of Wi-Fi networks, especially when setting up smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re facing similar issues with your Wi-Fi-connected devices, remember to check your router’s channel settings. Sometimes, a simple tweak is all it takes to ensure a smooth, seamless connection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="sonos" /><summary type="html">This is a recent experience I had with my new Sonos Era 100 speaker – a device that truly exceeded my expectations in terms of sound quality and design.

&lt;p&gt;When Apple announced the Watch Series 3, it made a significant push, inching a milestone that might just reshape the personal devices universe. Apple achieved what was previously unimaginable: creating a hand-worn device that operates independently from its handheld counterpart. In fact, some regarded 4G in the Watch as Apple’s most significant announcement in 2017, bigger than the iPhone X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although smartphones, used by over a billion people globally, may still be considered the most personal device type on the market, the undeniable global surge in the wearables market cannot be ignored. This trend began with fitness as the primary focus for wearable devices, which then evolved into companions for smartphones. However, wearables are poised to replace smartphones as the primary personal devices for consuming and sharing information, functioning independently without needing another device as a connectivity conduit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings up the question: As a developer, designer, content producer, or marketer, are you ready for this change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a marketer, I recognize mobile as a focal point in my industry. From the usability of products to avenues of advertising, mobile is leading the trends chart. Short-lived or not, this trend will evolve in itself; just like the screens on these mobiles. Back in 2013, screen fragmentation was the primary concern among the mobile concentrating community. It took four years and a leap of faith from manufacturers to standardize the process and put an end to this concern. Today, the same fragmentation is taking birth for devices in the ‘hands’ category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tap well &amp;amp; early, hand-worn devices or the wearables segment is to be taken seriously starting 2018. They should be viewed as independent devices, heralding entirely new consumer behaviors across various processes and cycles. For marketers like me, it even calls to reinvent mobile advertising as we know it, with new communication methods and units. Wearables like the Apple Watch are already fostering an ecosystem of apps and unique options designed exclusively for them. From locating your car in a parking lot or booking an Uber, to making reservations at your favorite restaurant, all these tasks are now possible directly from your wrist-worn device, without the need to unlock your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts: Will 2018 be the year when wearables emerge as devices to be taken seriously and considered individually, and not just as companion machines to smartphones?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="python" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Automating the Attendance Module at Work</title><link href="https://rishiraj.blog/2014/automating-attendance" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automating the Attendance Module at Work" /><published>2014-09-15T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2014-09-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://rishiraj.blog/2014/automating-attendance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rishiraj.blog/2014/automating-attendance">&lt;p&gt;This place I work has an online portal where every employee must login with their user credentials and log their attendance for the day. The problem is, everyone forgets to do that everyday. Its super messy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even I do forget to do it at times. I entered office at 9.30 today and logged my attendance at 10.20, when a reminder popped up on my phone. Technically I was half an hour early to work, but I’m gonna suffer a 20 minutes delay mark in my performance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to get over this, I have decided to hack and automate the attendance module. like a boss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the attendance module is a form, with three key input fields: 1) Username, 2) Password, and the 3) IN button. Employees have to fill up their assigned username and password, then punch the IN button to login their attendance for the day with date and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty easy to automate this process, at a trigger I can choose. What I can do is, simply use mechanize ( http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/ ) to automate the form. That simple, yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trigger can be anything. Maybe a time frame or as soon as I turn my computer on from 9am to 12pm on week days. Or maybe when I check in into my office using the Swarm app. I never forget to check in on 4sq/Swarm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I won’t be automating the Attendance Module. The attendance is a way I push myself to work early everyday, giving me some extra time to brainstorm or even prepare a list of things I need to get done that day. Cheerio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="python" /><category term="automation" /><summary type="html">This place I work has an online portal where every employee must login with their user credentials and log their attendance for the day.
