However, the setup process wasn’t as smooth as I anticipated, especially when it came to connecting the speaker to my Wi-Fi network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting to 5GHz Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit a snag. When I tried to set up the speaker using the Sonos app, I noticed that my 5GHz network wasn’t listed among the available Wi-Fi networks. Oddly enough, the 2.4GHz network appeared just fine. This was puzzling because media devices generally perform better on 5GHz networks due to their higher bandwidth capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Wi-Fi Channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to resolve this issue, I dived into some research. I learned that Wi-Fi networks operate on various channels, and these channels can affect the connectivity of devices. Specifically, the 5GHz band has a range of channels, and not all devices are compatible with every channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the Sonos works best on certain channels within the 5GHz band, particularly Channel 44. This was a revelation because my router was set to ‘Auto’ for channel selection, meaning it could have been using a channel incompatible with my Sonos speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: Manual Channel Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution was clear: I needed to manually set my router to use Channel 44 on the 5GHz band. After accessing my router’s settings and making this adjustment, I attempted to connect my Sonos speaker again. This time, it worked flawlessly! The speaker connected to the 5GHz network without any further issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my Sonos Era 100 is up and running on the 5GHz network, delivering the high-quality audio experience I was looking forward to. This experience taught me the importance of understanding the technical aspects of Wi-Fi networks, especially when setting up smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re facing similar issues with your Wi-Fi-connected devices, remember to check your router’s channel settings. Sometimes, a simple tweak is all it takes to ensure a smooth, seamless connection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="sonos" /><summary type="html">This is a recent experience I had with my new Sonos Era 100 speaker – a device that truly exceeded my expectations in terms of sound quality and design.

&lt;p&gt;When Apple announced the Watch Series 3, it made a significant push, inching a milestone that might just reshape the personal devices universe. Apple achieved what was previously unimaginable: creating a hand-worn device that operates independently from its handheld counterpart. In fact, some regarded 4G in the Watch as Apple’s most significant announcement in 2017, bigger than the iPhone X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although smartphones, used by over a billion people globally, may still be considered the most personal device type on the market, the undeniable global surge in the wearables market cannot be ignored. This trend began with fitness as the primary focus for wearable devices, which then evolved into companions for smartphones. However, wearables are poised to replace smartphones as the primary personal devices for consuming and sharing information, functioning independently without needing another device as a connectivity conduit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings up the question: As a developer, designer, content producer, or marketer, are you ready for this change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a marketer, I recognize mobile as a focal point in my industry. From the usability of products to avenues of advertising, mobile is leading the trends chart. Short-lived or not, this trend will evolve in itself; just like the screens on these mobiles. Back in 2013, screen fragmentation was the primary concern among the mobile concentrating community. It took four years and a leap of faith from manufacturers to standardize the process and put an end to this concern. Today, the same fragmentation is taking birth for devices in the ‘hands’ category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tap well &amp;amp; early, hand-worn devices or the wearables segment is to be taken seriously starting 2018. They should be viewed as independent devices, heralding entirely new consumer behaviors across various processes and cycles. For marketers like me, it even calls to reinvent mobile advertising as we know it, with new communication methods and units. Wearables like the Apple Watch are already fostering an ecosystem of apps and unique options designed exclusively for them. From locating your car in a parking lot or booking an Uber, to making reservations at your favorite restaurant, all these tasks are now possible directly from your wrist-worn device, without the need to unlock your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts: Will 2018 be the year when wearables emerge as devices to be taken seriously and considered individually, and not just as companion machines to smartphones?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="python" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Automating the Attendance Module at Work</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/automating-attendance" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automating the Attendance Module at Work" /><published>2014-09-15T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2014-09-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2014/automating-attendance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2014/automating-attendance">&lt;p&gt;This place I work has an online portal where every employee must login with their user credentials and log their attendance for the day. The problem is, everyone forgets to do that everyday. Its super messy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even I do forget to do it at times. I entered office at 9.30 today and logged my attendance at 10.20, when a reminder popped up on my phone. Technically I was half an hour early to work, but I’m gonna suffer a 20 minutes delay mark in my performance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to get over this, I have decided to hack and automate the attendance module. like a boss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the attendance module is a form, with three key input fields: 1) Username, 2) Password, and the 3) IN button. Employees have to fill up their assigned username and password, then punch the IN button to login their attendance for the day with date and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty easy to automate this process, at a trigger I can choose. What I can do is, simply use mechanize ( http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/ ) to automate the form. That simple, yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trigger can be anything. Maybe a time frame or as soon as I turn my computer on from 9am to 12pm on week days. Or maybe when I check in into my office using the Swarm app. I never forget to check in on 4sq/Swarm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I won’t be automating the Attendance Module. The attendance is a way I push myself to work early everyday, giving me some extra time to brainstorm or even prepare a list of things I need to get done that day. Cheerio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rishi Raj</name></author><category term="python" /><category term="automation" /><summary type="html">This place I work has an online portal where every employee must login with their user credentials and log their attendance for the day.
