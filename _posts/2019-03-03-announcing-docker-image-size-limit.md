## My story

It was an early morning. I was drinking my first cup of tea and reviewing a pull request from another developer.

It looked pretty well. Just some new `python` dependencies to generate beautiful reports. And a bunch of new `alpine` libraries to make sure everything will work.

So, I have merged it without any hesitations.

Several hours later I have found out that our image size increased from `~200 MiB` to `~1.5 GiB` in size. This is unacceptable!

So, I have written this script to restrict the maximum image size in the future:

{% raw %}
```bash
LIMIT=1024
IMAGE='your-image-name:latest'

SIZE="$(docker image inspect "$IMAGE" --format='{{.Size}}')"
test "$SIZE" -gt "$LIMIT" && echo 'Limit exceeded'; false
```
{% endraw %}

It is just like `js` [`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) library, but for `docker`.

And it worked pretty great. Now, our CI would fail on images that are bigger than our `$LIMIT`. But, do you know that we are using ["Blameless environment"](https://sobolevn.me/2018/12/blameless-environment) method? If something fails, fix it once and for all, including other projects as well. And now I have to distribute this code to all our projects by copy-pasting these four lines. And, of course, it is not how I like my code distribution.

## New project

As a result, I open-sourced this script as a standalone `python` CLI that can be distributed, installed, and used easily:

```
$ pip install docker-image-size-limit
$ disl your-image-name:label 300MiB
your-image-name:label exceeds 300MiB limit by 1200 MiB
```

And that's it.

Now, you can be sure that your image size will always be in control. Checkout out [the docs](https://github.com/wemake-services/docker-image-size-limit) for all possible options. And integrate it to your CI not to make the same mistakes I have already fixed.
