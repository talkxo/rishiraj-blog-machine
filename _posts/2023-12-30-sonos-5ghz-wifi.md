This is a recent experience I had with my new Sonos Era 100 speaker â€“ a device that truly exceeded my expectations in terms of sound quality and design. However, the setup process wasn't as smooth as I anticipated, especially when it came to connecting the speaker to my Wi-Fi network.

**Connecting to 5GHz Wi-Fi**

I hit a snag. When I tried to set up the speaker using the Sonos app, I noticed that my 5GHz network wasn't listed among the available Wi-Fi networks. Oddly enough, the 2.4GHz network appeared just fine. This was puzzling because media devices generally perform better on 5GHz networks due to their higher bandwidth capabilities.

**Understanding Wi-Fi Channels**

Determined to resolve this issue, I dived into some research. I learned that Wi-Fi networks operate on various channels, and these channels can affect the connectivity of devices. Specifically, the 5GHz band has a range of channels, and not all devices are compatible with every channel.

It turns out that the Sonos works best on certain channels within the 5GHz band, particularly Channel 44. This was a revelation because my router was set to 'Auto' for channel selection, meaning it could have been using a channel incompatible with my Sonos speaker.

**Solution: Manual Channel Adjustment**

The solution was clear: I needed to manually set my router to use Channel 44 on the 5GHz band. After accessing my router's settings and making this adjustment, I attempted to connect my Sonos speaker again. This time, it worked flawlessly! The speaker connected to the 5GHz network without any further issues.

Now, my Sonos Era 100 is up and running on the 5GHz network, delivering the high-quality audio experience I was looking forward to. This experience taught me the importance of understanding the technical aspects of Wi-Fi networks, especially when setting up smart home devices.

If you're facing similar issues with your Wi-Fi-connected devices, remember to check your router's channel settings. Sometimes, a simple tweak is all it takes to ensure a smooth, seamless connection.
