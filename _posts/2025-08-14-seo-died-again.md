# SEO Died (Again): Why Your Site Better Have Answers

Search engines dont want to send users to your site anymore. They want to answer questions directly. Googles AI Overviews, Perplexitys chat responses—theyre all cutting out the middleman. Your job now? Make sure your content feeds these answer machines.

During a recent client project, every decision came down to: Will this help us provide better answers? Heres what actually matters now.

## Breadcrumbs: Still Useful, But Not For SEO

Google killed breadcrumb rich snippets on mobile in January 2025. Theyre not SEO magic anymore. But they still help users understand where they are and how your content connects. Keep them simple—theyre for humans now, not search bots.

## Alt Text That Actually Helps

Stop writing product image and start writing ergonomic standing desk showing monitor at eye level. AI systems use this context to understand when your content answers workspace questions. Make it descriptive and useful.

## URLs That Make Sense

Your URLs should tell both humans and AI what question youre answering. /how-to/improve-seo/technical-elements/ is better than /post-847/ because it shows content hierarchy. Clean redirects when you change things—broken links kill trust.

## Internal Links as Answer Paths

Link related solutions together. Dont just scatter links everywhere hoping for SEO juice. Connect problem → method → solution in logical sequences. This helps AI understand your complete answer framework.

## The Core Web Vitals Reality Check

Heres the funny part: Googles own Pixel 9a page fails their PageSpeed test. Even Google cant hit perfect Core Web Vitals scores. Focus on actual user experience over chasing green badges. Fast enough beats perfectly measured.

## Mobile Navigation That Works

Hamburger menus and standard patterns exist for a reason—they work. Users need to move between related answers quickly. Dont reinvent navigation just to be different. Familiarity helps people find solutions faster.

## Stop Optimizing, Start Answering

The sites winning in 2025 arent the ones with perfect technical SEO. Theyre the ones that answer questions completely and connect related solutions naturally. AI can find and surface these comprehensive answers.

Build pages that work as standalone answers while connecting to bigger solution frameworks. Make content scannable, logical, and immediately useful.

SEO isnt dead—it just stopped caring about your keyword density.
