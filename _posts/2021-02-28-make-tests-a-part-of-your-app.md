Today marks the beginning of my fourth year at #ARM, where I started my professional journey three years ago as a college senior. This period has been transformative, shaping me personally and professionally. I've embraced what I call the 'efficacies of starting young at work,' crucial lessons that, while common, are best learned quickly for sharper results.

### Risk-Taking Appetite:
Joining the advertising and marketing industry, a shift from my tech-focused background, was my first major risk. This environment fostered decisiveness and risk-taking, from pitching ideas to adapting execution plans last-minute. Like a muscle, my decision-making skills strengthened, leading to quicker, more confident choices that spilled into my personal life. Starting young in a risk-taking culture accelerates self-growth and offers a "buffer zone" for experimentation.

### Time Awareness:
Valuing time has been my most significant lesson. Realizing its finite nature, I began optimizing my schedule. Arriving early at the office, meticulously using Google Calendar for planning work, meetings, and personal time, helped me stay focused on immediate tasks and upcoming commitments. This awareness, crucial in our early years, began with a simple habit: calendar management.

### Thinking Finance, Not Money:
I've been financially independent for years, from blogging in high school to freelancing in college. However, only recently did I shift from a money-centric view to a finance-focused approach. This means planning income and expenses, understanding taxes, and prioritizing investments over mere savings. Recognizing that money should grow alongside me was a pivotal moment in my journey to financial maturity.

In conclusion, starting these practices early provides a foundation for growth and course correction. For further reading, I recommend "Linchpin" by Seth Godin, "Managing Oneself" by Peter Drucker, and the "Managing Time" book from the HBR 20 Minute Manager series, especially for those in their 20s embarking on their careers.
