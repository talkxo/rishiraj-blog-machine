Every smart device in my house runs on its own timeline.

The TP-Link plug controlling the geyser has decided 4:47am is peak bathing hours. Not 4:45. Not 5:00. Specifically 4:47, because apparently that's when the firmware gods demanded hot water.

My Wipro bulbs take 3-7 business days to respond to Alexa. "Turn off bedroom light" happens sometime between now and next Diwali. Meanwhile the Syska bulb in the bathroom is having Vietnam flashbacks - one "Alexa, turn on bathroom light" and it strobes like a raid is happening.

The Phillips Wiz bulb? It connects to Wi-Fi only on Tuesdays. I've tested this. Monday? "Device unreachable." Wednesday? "Cannot find device." Tuesday at 3pm? Works like a dream.

Alexa pretends she can't understand "turn on the fan" but somehow perfectly hears and executes "ALEXA STOP" when I'm yelling at the smart plug that's gone rogue at midnight.

Best part? When the Airtel connection drops for 0.3 seconds, everything needs manual reconfiguration. One by one. Through three different apps. In Chinese.

The switchboard is right there. Mocking me.

## The Guest Demo

Friend visits: "Wow, smart home! Can you show me how it works?"

Me: "Sure, let me just... Alexa, turn on living room lights."  
Alexa: "Playing 'Living on a Prayer' by Bon Jovi."  
*Bathroom starts strobing*  
*Geyser turns on*  

Friend: "Maybe we should just use the switch?"  
Me: *defeated* "The switch doesn't understand Hindi either."

## Current Status

- **TP-Link**: Works 60% of the time, every time
- **Wipro**: Connects only during software updates  
- **Phillips Wiz**: Tuesday-only service
- **Alexa**: Selective hearing champion

*Phone storage: 2.3GB of apps*  
*Actual functionality: 23 minutes per week*

In a world where everything is connected, nothing actually connects.
