This talk is dedicated to the quality of tests.

As we all know not so many developers actually care about it.
This may lead to bugs and useless tests that just consume your time and CI resources.

You can fight for the quality of your tests with the help of mutation tests.

I have also made a [small github repo](https://github.com/sobolevn/heisenbug-2019)
to show some code samples.

P.S. This talk was [also presented](https://conf.python.ru/2019/abstracts/5159)
on MoscowPythonConf++ the same year as a reserved one, because one of the speakers was not able to come.
