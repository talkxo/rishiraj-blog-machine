The main idea of this talk was: it is easy to start a modern web app.
And we even provide the latest tech to do it: [wemake-vue-template](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-vue-template)

I have also covered all the things that are quite important
to the large-scale Vue projects, including:

- documentation
- typing, linting, and testing
- SSR and business logic
