The main idea of this talk was: a11y covers more cases that people are usually told.
I also made it clear that a11y and SRE is almost the same thing. But from different angles.

I have also featured our `Vue` template with all a11y features enabled and checked: [wemake-vue-template](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-vue-template)
