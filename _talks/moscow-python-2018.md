The main idea of this talk was: it is easy to start a modern web app.
And we even provide the latest tech to do it: [wemake-django-template](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template)

I have covered how this tool can be helpful for all team members.

I have also covered all the things that are quite important
to the large-scale `django` projects.
