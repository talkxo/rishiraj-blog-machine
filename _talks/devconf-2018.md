This talk was revealing the sad truth about the money we earn as employees.
I tried to show all the problems in this model.

It is beneficial for an employee just to earn money while doing nothing.
It is beneficial for employers to pay less
and force people to work as hard as possible.

I have also offered them to take
a look at the alternative solution: [RSDP](https://wemake-services.github.io/meta).
