This talk covers [a simple process](https://wemake-services.github.io/meta/)
we follow in our company to document the code we write.

The main idea of the process is to:

- refuse to work by creating bug reports until task is clear
- pay for found bugs in documentation
- restrict informal communication

It also mentions other processes we have.
