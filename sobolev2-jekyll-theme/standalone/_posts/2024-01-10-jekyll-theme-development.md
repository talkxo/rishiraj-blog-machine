Creating modern Jekyll themes requires understanding both the technical aspects of Jekyll and modern web development practices.

## Key Considerations

### Performance
- Optimize images and assets
- Use modern CSS techniques
- Implement lazy loading
- Minimize JavaScript usage

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid systems
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Best Practices

1. **Modular CSS**: Use SCSS with organized partials
2. **Liquid Templates**: Create reusable includes
3. **Configuration**: Make everything configurable
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear setup instructions

## Theme Architecture

The Sobolev2 theme follows these principles:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Flexible layout system
- Easy customization options
- Performance optimization

Building themes is both an art and a science, requiring attention to both design and technical implementation.
