## Credits

This website is proudly powered by [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open‑source static site generator. It can really simplify the process of publishing and maintaining a blog, especially if you have some basic familiarity with the command line and Git. A simple, static structure also helps toward a fast, secure and scalable website.

It also leverages Markdown to ensure updates and posts can be made quickly, without CMS formatting complexities.

All the source code is managed on [`GitHub`](https://pages.github.com/). The website is also hosted using GitHub Pages. It's easy and simple!

The website layout draws inspiration from the innovative design of **Nikita Sobolev**. This design approach helps create an intuitive, user‑friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface for reading.

Fonts are hosted on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/); my favorites are **Nunito Sans** for the title and **Source Sans 3** for the body. We also use a small script from Soopr to allow easy and efficient content sharing.
