This website is proudly powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open-source static site generator.  It can really simplify the process of publishing and maintaining a blog, especially if you have some basic familiarity with the command line and Git. A simple, static structure also helps towards a fast, secure, and scalable website.

It also leverages Markdown to ensure updates and posts can be made quickly, without the CMS formatting complexities.

All the source code for our website is managed on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/). The website is also hosted using GitHub Pages, which is **free-of-cost** and without any downtime hiccups.

The website layout draws inspiration from the innovative design of **Nikita Sobolev**. This design approach helps in creating an intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing interface for reading.

To enhance readability and visual appeal, we utilize fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/); my favorites, **Nunito Sans** for title and **Source Sans 3** for body. We also use a small script from Soopr to allow easy and efficient content sharing.

Stock photos on the site are usually from Unsplash, with due credit.

The integration of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) empowers us with valuable insights into visitor behavior and site performance. This data drives our continuous efforts to optimize the user experience and content relevance.
