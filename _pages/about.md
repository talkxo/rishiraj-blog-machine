### Building things for the web since 2006

Hi, my name is Rishi Raj and I'm a  **multi-disciplinary marketer** from New Delhi, India. My expertise lies in strategic planning, content and communications, and in creating effective team processes. I have been a planning leader to teams delivering award-winning solutions for A-list brands including Microsoft, OPPO, Jack Daniel's, Accor Hotels, MTV, and Cargill Foods. 

### Work

I run a digital services company called [TalkXO](https://hello.talkxo.com). I work with a young team of marketers & techies on marketing automation and creative content solutions for big & small businesses.

In my previous avatars, I have been ...

- a **senior director** at a leading independent agency, where I participated in the 0-1 journey
- an app development & sales executive
- a freelancer offering SEO and content marketing services
- an **UI + graphics designer** at a leading messaging company
- a **web publisher** (later, sold) of a popular tech blog
