### Building things for the web since 2006

Hi, my name is Rishi Raj and I'm a  **multi-disciplinary marketer** from New Delhi, India. My expertise lies in strategic planning, content and communications, and in creating effective team processes. I have been a planning leader to teams delivering award-winning solutions for A-list brands including Microsoft, OPPO, Jack Daniel's, Accor Hotels, MTV, and Cargill Foods. 

### Work

I work as the CEO at [TalkXO and Kinsight](https://hello.talkxo.com), I also happen to be a founder of these company. I work with a small, smart team of young marketers & technologists, providing marketing automation and content services to B2B startups.

In my previous avatars, I have been ...

- a freelancer offering SEO and content marketing services
- an **UI + graphics designer** at a leading messaging company
