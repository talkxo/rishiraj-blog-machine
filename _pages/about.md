### Building things for the web since 2006

Hi, my name is Rishi Raj and I'm a **multi-disciplinary marketer** from New Delhi, India. My expertise lies in strategic planning, content and communications, and creating effective team processes. I have been a planning leader to teams delivering award‑winning solutions for A‑list brands including Microsoft, OPPO, Jack Daniel’s, Accor Hotels, MTV and Cargill Foods.

### Work

I run a digital services company called [TalkXO](https://hello.talkxo.com). I work with a young team of marketers and techies on marketing automation and creative content solutions for big and small businesses. I like building things — ideas, systems and the occasional product that makes work smoother. My work tends to sit at the intersection of creativity, technology and business growth.

In my previous avatars, I have been …

- a **senior director** at a leading independent agency, where I participated in the 0‑1 journey
- an app development and sales executive
- a freelancer offering SEO and content marketing services
- a **UI + graphics designer** at a leading messaging company
- a **web publisher** of a popular tech blog (later sold)

### Around here

This blog is where I keep notes on what I’m learning, questions I’m asking, and sometimes just things I find interesting.

If you’re curious about the tools I use or the setup behind this site, check out the [Stuff I Use](/stuff/) page or the [Colophon](/colophon/).

Outside of work, I read a lot, explore new ideas and occasionally get lost in deep research rabbit holes.
